The user wants me to create a comprehensive HTML page for "Page 1.4 — Payment Rails & Routing" following the same design patterns as the previous pages. This page is about payment infrastructure configuration and optimization.

Let me create a fully functional, responsive HTML page with:

Connected Banks Directory - list of banks with status, health, supported rails, etc.
Routing Rules Engine - smart routing configuration with rules
Rail Performance Analytics - charts/stats for success rates, settlement times, costs
Rail Configuration - enable/disable, limits, credentials, webhooks
Nostro/Vostro Account Mapping - balances, reconciliation, auto-sweep, FX
I'll use the same glassmorphism design, sidebar with anchor links, modals for actions, tabs for organization, and make it fully responsive.
